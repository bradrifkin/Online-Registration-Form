# Online Registration Form

This project was Project #3 as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. The project incorporates mobile-first design using HTML, CSS, and flexbox layout. In this project, I created a mobile-friendly registration form based on a mockup for a small screen size. With one media query, and with the help of flexbox, I adjusted the layout to adjust to a tablet, laptop, and desktop size.
